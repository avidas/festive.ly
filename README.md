Festively - Find Nearby Festivals
====

[Festively](http://festively.herokuapp.com/), created during Code for the Kingdom hackathon, lets you find local religious festivals near you. The idea is to experience being a member of a different religion/religious group for a day to broaden interfaith awareness. Volunteering at festivals would appear to be a good way of going about this. Potential sources of data could be eventbrite events, meetup and scraping interfaith calendars. This could be really useful for travelers going to new places. For event organizers, this could be handy as extra volunteers could mean greater success for the event. 

It would be great to have this as an API somewhere.
